int y = 20;
double * ptr2 = &y; INVALID
int x = 20;
int * ptr = &x; VALID

// Example:
x = 20; standard integer
&x = 0x111; address operator gives address of var
ptr = &x = 0x111; ptr can only store memory addresses
*ptr = *(0x111) = 20; references the value at address
&ptr = 0x222; address operator gives address of pointer

// if *ptr is modified, then x is also modified.
